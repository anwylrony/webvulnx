# WebVulnX
"WebVulnX" is a conceptual Python-based tool designed to emulate the thought process of a seasoned bug hunter. It's not a magic bullet, but a powerful assistant that automates the tedious parts of reconnaissance and initial vulnerability scanning.
Core Philosophy:

Intelligent Reconnaissance: It doesn't just scan a single URL. It crawls the website to understand its structure, just like a human would.
Multi-Vector Scanning: It targets the most critical and common vulnerability classes: SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Command Injection.
Adaptive WAF Bypass: It doesn't give up when blocked. It attempts to bypass Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) using common obfuscation techniques.
Clear Reporting: It provides a concise, color-coded report of its findings.

WebVulnX Pro is a sophisticated, Python-based vulnerability scanner designed to emulate the thought process of a seasoned penetration tester. It goes beyond simple scanners by integrating a headless browser to crawl modern, JavaScript-heavy applications, handle authentication, and intelligently bypass Web Application Firewalls (WAFs).

## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8 or higher
*   `pip` (Python package installer)

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/anwyllrony/webvulnx-pro.git
    cd webvulnx-pro
    ```

2.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Or manually: `pip install requests beautifulsoup4 playwright`)*

## üí° Usage

### Basic Scan

Scan a single URL and let the tool discover and test all links and forms within the default depth.

```bash
python webvulnx_pro.py http://testphp.vulnweb.com
```

### Authenticated Scan

Scan a protected application by providing login credentials.

```bash
python webvulnx_pro.py http://example.com/dashboard \
  --login-url http://example.com/login \
  -u your_username \
  -p your_password
```

### Save Results to a File

Export the scan results to a JSON file for later analysis or reporting.

```bash
python webvulnx_pro.py http://testphp.vulnweb.com -o vulnerability_report.json
```

### Command-Line Options

| Option                | Description                                                    |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `url`                 | The target URL to start the scan from.                         |
| `--depth`             | Maximum crawling depth (default: 2).                           |
| `--login-url`         | The URL of the login page for authentication.                  |
| `-u`, `--username`    | Username for the login form.                                   |
| `-p`, `--password`    | Password for the login form.                                   |
| `-o`, `--output`      | File path to save the JSON report.                             |

### How to Use the Dependency File

With the `requirements.txt` file in your project directory, you can install all the necessary packages with a single command.

1.  **Navigate to your project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd path/to/webvulnx-pro
    ```

2.  **Install the dependencies using pip:**
    It's highly recommended to do this inside a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    # Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

    # Install all packages from the file
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Install Playwright Browsers (Crucial Final Step):**
    After installing the `playwright` Python package, you must install the browser binaries it controls. This is a separate command.
    ```bash
    playwright install
    ```

This command downloads Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit browser engines to your system, allowing Playwright to function.

### Alternative (Modern) Approach: `pyproject.toml`

For more modern Python projects, you can use a `pyproject.toml` file. This is becoming the new standard for defining project metadata and dependencies.

Create a file named `pyproject.toml` with the following content:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=61.0"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

[project]
name = "webvulnx-pro"
version = "1.0.0"
description = "Advanced Automated Vulnerability Discovery for Authorized Testing"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.8"
license = {text = "MIT"}
authors = [
    {name = "Your Name", email = "your.email@example.com"},
]
keywords = ["pentesting", "security", "vulnerability", "scanner", "bug-hunting"]
classifiers = [
    "Programming Language :: Python :: 3",
    "License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License",
    "Operating System :: OS Independent",
]
dependencies = [
    "requests>=2.28.0",
    "beautifulsoup4>=4.11.0",
    "playwright>=1.40.0",
]

[project.urls]
Homepage = "https://github.com/your-username/webvulnx-pro"
"Bug Tracker" = "https://github.com/your-username/webvulnx-pro/issues"
```

**How to use `pyproject.toml`:**

You would install the project in "editable" mode, which also installs its dependencies:
```bash
pip install -e .
```
And you would still need to run `playwright install` separately.

---

**Recommendation:**

For this project, **`requirements.txt` is perfectly sufficient and simpler for most users.** It's universally understood and gets the job done without extra complexity. Stick with `requirements.txt` unless you plan to distribute this as a formal package on PyPI.


## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1.  **Authentication (Optional):** If credentials are provided, the tool first navigates to the login URL, parses the form, and submits the credentials to establish a session.
2.  **Advanced Crawling:** Using Playwright, it launches a headless Chromium browser. It navigates the target site, executing JavaScript. It intercepts network requests to discover API endpoints and parses the final DOM to find all links and forms, recursively up to the specified depth.
3.  **Scanning:** For every discovered URL with parameters and every form, the tool launches a series of tests. It injects payloads for each vulnerability class.
4.  **WAF Detection & Bypass:** If a request is blocked (e.g., HTTP 403), the tool analyzes the response headers to fingerprint the WAF. It then generates a set of tailored bypass payloads (e.g., Unicode encoding, comment obfuscation) and retries the request.
5.  **Analysis & Reporting:** The tool analyzes the server's response for each payload, looking for error messages, reflected content, command output, or time-based delays. Any confirmed vulnerabilities are collected and displayed in a final report, which can also be saved to a JSON file.

## üêõ Limitations & Future Work

This tool is a proof-of-concept and has limitations:

*   **Authentication:** The login module is designed for standard form-based authentication and may not handle complex flows like Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) or OAuth2 without modification.
*   **API Testing:** API endpoint discovery is included, but in-depth API fuzzing (e.g., with complex JSON objects) is not fully implemented.
*   **Blind Vulnerabilities:** Time-based detection for blind vulnerabilities is rudimentary and can be prone to false positives/negatives due to network latency.
*   **CAPTCHAs:** The tool cannot solve CAPTCHAs.

Future improvements could include:
*   Support for OAuth2 and JWT-based authentication.
*   A dedicated module for in-depth REST API fuzzing.
*   More sophisticated blind vulnerability detection.
*   HTML/PDF report generation.
